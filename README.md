# Sparta Rock Paper Scissors

I was tasked with creating a rock, paper, scissors emulator using javascript.

We had recently learned functions so my main focus was to attempt to use as many as possible within reason. This turned out to be 4 functions in total.

I used mostly javascript with html being used simply for the link.

I believed I captured all the elements of Rock, Paper, Scissors in this task and will unlikely need to return to add anything to this code.
